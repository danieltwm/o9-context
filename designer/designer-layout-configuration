In the o9 platform, currently the widget containers have an option to expand to the full View. But sometimes when a KPI or a similar widget that
takes a smaller space is added to a container and expanded, the expanded View has a lot of white space which is not useful and gets in the way of
other widgets. In such cases, the user requires the expand button to be disabled.

This runtime feature provides the option to enable or disable the expand button for the widget container.

1. Login to any tenant with the relevant credentials.
2. Navigate to a View (in this example the View is Dashboard).
3. Go to the Design layout mode.
4. Click the ellipsis icon **( )** on the upper-right of the container. The option **Disable Expand** is displayed.

### Enable & Disable Expand Option for Widget Container


5. Click **Disable Expand**. The Expand report icon **( )** on that container is removed at runtime but is still available for other containers.

For a container which already has the **Disable Expand** option disabled, the list will display the **Enable Expand** option.


```
The dashboard View is more suitable for reporting and displays high level reports and KPIs.
```
```

**Modify Other Details**
You can click **( )** on the upper-right of the report name in case you need to update the following information.


```
i. Rename : This option allows you to change the name of the report.
ii. Edit-<Report Name> : This option allows you to modify the configuration of the report from the View in the Design mode and you do not have to go to the Designer workspace
to update the source report. In this example, the name of the report is Edit-Bubble Chart.
```
iii. **Promote Report filters** : This option allows you to update the filters for the selected report.

```
Note Since the layout in the image above does not have any anchored widget, each widget can have different filters.
```
```
As displayed in the image above, the bubble chart report filters can be promoted at three levels:
```
```
a. Self : The Self level is selected by default. The filters with the Self level is only applicable for the source report. They will be visible and applicable only when the report is
selected and not shared with other reports on the View.
In the Dashboard, all report filters are applicable to Self. When the network report is selected, the filters are taken from the network report configuration.
```

When the bubble chart is selected, the filter changes to bubble chart report filters and filter sharing does not take place.

Similarly, other reports have filters which are applicable to Self.


b. **None** : Filters with the None option are not applicable for the report. They are not visible on the UI. Select None in the Category list and it will not be visible on the UI.

c. **View** : If a filter is promoted to the View then it will be applicable for this View. It will be visible for all the reports of this View. For example, if the Time filter is selected and
promoted to the View then all the reports will display data for the selected time such as FY2017. In this example, the Fiscal Month filter is promoted to the View level.


```
This filter will be applicable to all the reports in the View as shown in the images below.
```
```

You can click **( )** next to the line chart. The options are displayed.

```

```
The Version filters are generally promoted to the workspace level so that users don’t need to select version or scenario again within a workspace.
The Product filters are shared at the View level.
Users can select the Global or the None option as required.
```
```
In this example, the Fiscal Month filter is shared at the page level for the month of M02-2012. This is a member filter expression for M02-2012:

This enhancement introduces a new 'Auto Load Data' flag for views, allowing reports to be loaded with data automatically when accessed by the user or held empty until the user
has applied scope filters or clicked ‘Refresh Data’.
```
### Manual Trigger of Data Load on Reports


Many planning users will need to access Views containing large volumes of data, which take time to open and require adjustments with filters and
layout changes. They can then be configured as desired before being loaded with data. This will improve efficiency and reduce frustration over user
interface loading times.
The 'Auto Load Data' flag will allow planners to quickly configure these reports without waiting for any data to be initially loaded into the user
interface. Since data is loaded only after configuration by clicking 'Apply' (from scope filters) or 'Refresh Data' (from global header), this will provide
a better user experience.

**Prerequisites**

```
A View with the relevant reports configured.
```
**Setup**

1. Log in to a tenant with the relevant credentials.
2. Go to the Design layout for the View that needs to be manually loaded.
3. Click Edit in the View settings.


The **Edit Minimize Data Load** dialog box is displayed with the new **Auto Load Data** checkbox.

4. Select the **Auto Load Data** checkbox.

```
The Auto Load Data flag is enabled by default.
To disable it, click to clear the Auto Load Data flag.
```
5. Click the **Save** icon **( )**. The changes are saved.

**User Workflow**

```
Any User > My Reports
```
1. Log in to a tenant with the relevant credentials.
2. Go to a View with the **Auto Load Data** flag disabled. The reports on the View are displayed without data loaded.


3. Click the layout and make any changes as required.
4. Click the scope filters and make any changes as required. The **Apply** button is displayed with an indicator icon.
5. Click the Apply button. The View displays the data with the selected filters and layout changes.


```
This functionality is currently applicable only to ‘Pivot / Indented Grid / Master Data’ and ‘Line /Horizontal Bar/ Area/Waterfall Chart’ type reports. If any other report
type is present on the View, data is loaded automatically for those reports.
Clicking the ‘Refresh Data’ button available on the global header, will also load the data.
For the charts ‘Setting’, ‘Toggle’ and ‘Cumulative’ options will be enabled even without any data. Data will be loaded after clicking ‘Apply’ on filter or ‘Refresh Data’
on the global ribbon.
For pivot reports ‘Download’, ‘Layout’, ‘Action Button’ (non-widget binding),’ Open o9 Excel’, ‘Measure set’ options will be enabled even without any data. Data will
be loaded after clicking ‘Apply’ on filter or ‘Refresh Data’ on the global ribbon.
Once a View is loaded, any further changes to filters or layout, etc., will automatically trigger reloading.
A browser refresh or a session timeout will make the view load without any data.
View/Scope filters, layout settings, etc., will load with the default favorite selections.
Favorites can be created without data loaded for the view.
The PDF Download will be downloaded with data irrespective of the above View-level settings.
Online meetings will not display data if View capture is done when data is not loaded.
Recapture/Refresh Deck for Online Meetings will display data irrespective of the above view-level settings.
When navigating between Views through navigation settings or action buttons or global workflows or back button data will be displayed irrespective of destination
view-level settings.
