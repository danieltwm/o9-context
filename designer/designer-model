The Designer workspace enables a user to design a complete tenant data model in real time. A user can create any number of dimensions,
attributes, and hierarchies. It allows a user to model any number of plans and measures which is required by the tenant data model without
restarting the tenant GraphCubeServer.
```
```
Click Edit Model on the upper-left of the Designer workspace and the Model Designer area is displayed.
```
```
Tenant admin users need to build o9 model from the Designer workspace for speedy configuration and model
development. The Designer workspace is used for model design and model maintenance. Earlier, different
workspaces were used to design and maintain the tenant data model. The process consumed a great amount of time
and understanding of data modelling steps. To configure various elements, users were required to switch to different
workspaces.
The Designer workspace also supports data modelling and management requirements.

Procedure
```
In Designer, two distinct modes exist for editing Model and Reports. In order to perform any action, users need to
ensure that they are working in the correct edit mode. The user workflow is improved as the selection is made
automatic. Users no longer need to toggle the edit modes, explicitly.
The Edit Reports and Edit Model buttons in the Designer are no longer visible because the Toggle Mode is introduced.
On the Designer load, both the models area and reports area are displayed. Users can navigate through the tabs to
any entity that they need to view or edit.

```
Note If you click an entity, it is displayed in the Edit mode by default.
All the secondary actions are available just as before.
```
### Toggle Mode


```
Measure Edit Area
```
```
Report
```
If you click a measure, the measure edit area is displayed (as shown in the image below). Here, you can edit the
measure config, and other primary or secondary actions can be performed just as before.

```
Note If you close the measure, it takes you to the original starting point (as shown in the Image: Designer Landing Page ).
```
If you click a report, it is displayed as the image shown below. If you click **( )** , the entity’s config is displayed as a

pop-up window.

```
Note The actions to drag and drop entities to the reports area and the other secondary actions are available just as before.
```
In Designer, the Search box is placed above each of the Models tab to ensure that the user can find the entities that
they are looking for quickly and easily.

In Designer, the **Search** box is moved above each of the models tab.

### Unified Search for All Tabs


After you type a text in the **Search** box and click the search icon **( )** or press Enter, all the tabs are filtered by the
provided string.


If you switch to another tab, it will also be filtered for the same string.


If you click the cross icon **( )** , it will remove the filtering.


The user types a keyword in the Filter field and press Enter or clicks the Filter icon **( )**. The active tabs are filtered
using the search keyword which is provided and all other tabs which contain matches display an indicator but in the
inactive tabs, this filtering of trees becomes optional.

1. Type a search keyword in the Filter field.

### Optional Filtering for Inactive Models Tabs


2. Press Enter or click the Filter icon **( )**. The active tab is filtered using the search keyword that is provided.
3. Click the **Plan** tab. The unfiltered tree is displayed by default.
4. Select the **Apply Filter** checkbox. The tree is filtered using the search keyword that is provided.


5. Go to a tab which has no matches. An unfiltered tree is displayed with the following message: **no matches found**


## Model Entities


A tenant’s configuration on the platform consists of several different types of model entities, such as Dimensions, Plans,
Graphs, Rules, etc. These are accessible through the left **Model** pane in Designer. An average tenant config contains
hundreds of these entities which are highly interconnected.

```
A dimension entity is a collection of related objects called attributes (Level Attributes). For example, customer, product, or sales domain.
```
```
Sales Forecast measure is described using the dimensions, such as product, sales domain and time, whereas a
budget measure is described using different dimensions, such as spend domain and time.
```
```
In the Designer, when a new entity, such as Dim, Attribute, Measure, etc. is added to a Dimension, it is displayed in an
alphabetical order so that the user finds it easily.
```
```
The Order Dimension's Position for Filters is the attribute placement in the filter pane of the Designer. The Order
Dimension's Position for Filters can be changed from the Reports home page or dashboard.
```
```
There were few actions on system entities that were causing data and start-up issues. Hence, these actions are now blocked.
```
```
Add a Dimension
```
1. Go to the **Designer** workspace.
2. Click the **DIMENSION** tab.

### Dimension


3. Click **( )** next to **All Dimensions**. The **Add a Dimension** dialog box is displayed.

```
Note
```
```
To add any existing Dimension, you can also just click it. The related attributes and hierarchies are displayed automatically.
To remove any related attributes or hierarchies, you can just click ( ) next to them. For example, if you select the Activity
dimension then the Activity Name is automatically displayed as one of its attributes. In case, you do not need this attribute, you
can click ( ) next to the Activity Name ( ) and it gets deleted.
```
```
Note For more information on Attibute and Member Info, click Dimension
```
```
Plans are the placeholder for the measure groups. They are logical groups of similar measure groups. The PLAN tab enables you to configure
Plans, Measure Groups and Measures.
```
```
Add a Plan
```
1. Go to the **Designer** workspace.

### Plan


2. Click the **Edit Model** tab. The **Model Designer** area is displayed.
3. Click the **Plan** tab. The **Plan** tabbed area is displayed.


4. Click **( )** next to the Search box. The **Add a Plan** dialog box is displayed.
5. Type the name of the plan in the **Plan Name** box.
6. Type the description of the plan in the **Description** box.
7. Click **( )**. The relevant plan is added in the **Plan** tabbed area.

```
For more information, click Plan
```
```
A Graph relates members in one dimension to members in another dimension (or in the same dimension) in a non-hierarchical manner. It is
difficult to capture all possible cases of modelling in a hierarchical data structure. Graph relationship creates a direct link between one member
to another member (or) one set of members to another set of members. Graph relationship has a To node and a From node, which will use
prefixes To and From to represent the Destination and Source of the graph, respectively.
```
```
For more information, click Graph
```
```
Go to the Designer workspace and click the RULE tab to add the tenant specific rules. The changes that you make here is applied in real-time.
```
### Graph

### Rule


```
The RULE tab allows:
```
```
Active Rules for measure computations
Named Sets for a set of members
On Demand Procedures
Data Security Rules
```
```
Note Users with the admin user role do not need to restart the GraphCube server for these model changes.
```
```
For more information, click Rule
```
```
Receiving timely alerts enables users to take the required decisions to address the challenges posed by the changes to important metrics.
```
```
Users can configure data alerts in Designer with the drag-and-drop operation instead of writing the IBPL queries (as
was supported in the 1st generation Alerts in o9). These alerts can then be associated with the relevant reports.
Users can also create strategies called Resolution Plays and associate those with appropriate alerts. These Resolution
Plays offer a set of possibilities to systematically resolve the alerts.
```
```
For more information, click Alert
```
```
In a complex tenant configuration with many interdependencies between different model entities, the process of
deciphering these relationships by manually clicking through the Designer UI is tedious. Easy and reliable access to
this information is essential to understand the solution and to make changes to the configuration, like introduction of
new entities or identification of obsolete entities. With this feature, configurators can see which reports a given attribute
is used in.
```
1. Login to the o9 Web UI with the relevant credentials.
2. Go to the **Designer** Workspace.

10. Click any report listed. A new area is displayed (inline Designer) showing the configuration for the chosen report.


```
Note The inline Designer View is for viewing only. Any changes applied on it can be previewed, but cannot be saved.
For attributes, reports and measure groups where it is used are listed.
```
```
Note
```
```
The configurators will not know where the measures are used while working with the Designer workspace. Hence, they will not be
aware of the impact of any changes that they might want to apply, or even if the measures were redundant. With this feature, the
configurators can see where all measures are being used, so that they would be able to quickly identify the impact and make
modifications accordingly.
```
```
For more information, click #Support Where Used for Measure and Dimension Attributes.
```
The o9 tenant’s configuration consists of different entities, such as dimensions, attributes, measures, reports,
workspaces and so on. Some entities reference other entities in their configurations. For example, a report references
a set of attributes and measures that are used in it. In a typical implementation, these usage relationships between
entities can be fairly complex. It is essential for a platform user to be able to visualize these relationships and
understand them with ease in order to develop high quality solutions.

This enhancement is a part of a series of enhancements to build comprehensive support for visibility of entity usage
and dependency information in the platform. It introduces support for showing measure usage in plugins.

Measure usage in plugins is available in Designer. It can be accessed by opening a measure’s config from the Plan
tree. It is located in the **Where Used** tab as indicated in the screenshot below.

All GraphCube plugins wherever a measure is used is displayed here. This includes the following types of plugins:

```
RScriptTimeSeries
RScriptGeneralized
PythonScript
TalentMatchSolver
StatForecast
SummaryStats
ReplaceNulls
Pareto
ReceiptsConstrainedPlan
ReceiptsUnconstrainedPlan
BosToInventory
InventoryToBos
EndingOnHandPlan
```
### Measures in Plugins


```
ReplenishmentPlan
PeriodToDatePlan
NetworkPlan
SupplyChainSolver
CumulativePlan
LPSolver
```
```
Note The tenant plugins are not displayed here. This includes JavaScript and Python plugins.
```
The configurators will not know where the measures are used while working with the Designer workspace. Hence, they
will not be aware of the impact of any changes that they might want to apply, or even if the measures were redundant.
With this feature, the configurators can see where all measures are being used, so that they would be able to quickly
identify the impact and make modifications accordingly.

The planners often want to use more than just the SKU or the Brand name in reports to enhance the visibility. To
support this, the platform had support for one image per member. However, for a number of customers especially in the
retail sector, multiple images are required to help the planners and stakeholders visualize their portfolio.

**Setting up the Member to Support Multiple Images**

1. Login to the o9 Web UI with the relevant credentials.
2. Go to the **Designer** workspace.
3. Click the relevant dimension for the level attribute for which you want to upload the multiple images. In this example
the Product dimension is selected.
4. Click the Settings icon **( )** next to the relevant attribute in the **Attributes** area. In this example, ProductGroup
attribute is selected.

### Multi Image Support


The Settings dialog box is displayed.

5. Select the **Multiple Images** checkbox.
6. Click **( )**. The changes are saved and your level attribute is set up to support the multiple images.

```
Note If you clear the Multiple Images checkbox, it will delete the internal property and the data associated with it.
```
**Uploading the Images**
Create a .csv file with the member name and image source URL. The .csv should be in the following format:

```
Column headers - Dimension.LevelAttribute , Images
Column content - Member1 , url1 | url2
```

For example:

```
Product.ProductGroup1 Images
01360000070 https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp9382347.jpg
01360000000 https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp9382347.jpg
```
```
Note The URLs should not be enclosed in quotation marks (“”)
The URLs should be separated by a pipe operator (|)
```
2. Upload the file using the SSIS job.

**View the Images**

1. Go to the report with the said level attribute configured.
2. Click the relevant member name for which you want to see the images. The **Member Info** dialog box is displayed.


```
Note The number displayed below the thumbnails depicts the additional number of images associated with the member.
```
3. Click the thumbnail. The strip of images associated with the member is displayed.
4. Click the thumbnails at the bottom to go to the required image.

```
Note The grid images are still pegged to the older functionality. Hence, the older flow remains as is for the grid images.
```
1. Login to the o9 tenant with relevant credentials.
2. Go to the **Designer** workspace.
3. Click the particular attribute for which you want to add multiple images.

**Multiple Image Upload for End Users**
