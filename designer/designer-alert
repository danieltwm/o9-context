```
The resolution plays redirect the user to the View which is selected below the section View , by default.
You can configure a separate View for newly created scenarios in the New Scenario View section if required.
```
50. Click **Save Alert Play**. The Resolution Play is associated with the alert.

## Add the Created Alert to Relevant Report


59. Go to the **Designer** workspace to create a new action button.
60. Select **Alert** in the **Type** list.
61. Enter the relevant name in the **Name** field.
62. Enter the relevant display name in the **DisplayName** field.
63. Select the relevant icon in the **Icon** list.
64. Go to the **Alert** tabbed area.

```
In the Alert tabbed area, there are two options for the action button execution:
```
```
Run Play : If you select this, it will execute the resolution play and also trigger the alerts recalculation.
Run Alert : If you select this, it will only trigger the alerts recalculation.
```
65. Select the **Run Play** checkbox.
66. Select the relevant Resolution Play in the **Play** list.


67. Click **Save**. The action button is saved.
68. Add the alert action button to the target View of the Resolution Play.
69. Go to the **Alert** View to resolve the alert.
70. Right-click the alert indicator.
71. Click **Show Alert Analytics**. The Alert Member Info dialog box is displayed.
72. Click the resolution play to create a new scenario. The **Scenario Name** dialog box is displayed with the auto-filled
name (Resolution Play + Date text format).


73. Modify the name as required.
74. Click **OK**. The View that was selected in the **New Scenario View** is displayed while associating the resolution play
with the alert.

```
A new private scenario is created which has the given scenario name. If you view an already saved scenario,
you are redirected to the View that is selected under the View section while associating resolution play with
the alert.
```
75. Run the action button associated with the Resolution Play. The alert action buttons are of async type and after the
action button is executed, the notification is displayed.


76. Refresh the data. The new member values and alert states are displayed.

The next time when you try to resolve the same alert after you click **Show Alert Analytics** , this earlier resolution is
displayed to you. You can either select this scenario or create a new one as required.


```
The platform supports scheduling the execution of a Rule-type action button, using a datetime measure as the trigger.
```
```
Why is this required?
SRM workflows involve time-sensitive events, such as the bidding process, where buyers set precise opening and
closing times for supplier participation. It is crucial that these bidding events commence and conclude simultaneously
for all involved parties, strictly adhering to the buyer's defined schedule. Consequently, suppliers are restricted to
submitting quote responses only within this specified timeframe and are prevented from editing or submitting outside of
it. Within the platform, these events are governed by measure status and therefore, it is critical for the platform to
support the ability to update the measure status and execute other required actions precisely at the scheduled event
time.
```
```
Prerequisites
The Admin user role is required to access the Plans (offline) workspace.
```
```
Setup
```
1. Login into the platform with the relevant credentials.
2. Go to the **Plans (offline)** workspace.
3. Click the **Add new record** button.

## Time Based Scheduler


4. Click **Event Based Scheduler** in the **Alert Type** list.
5. Enter a name and description for your alert.


6. Go to the **Trigger Config** tabbed area.
7. Configure the following details:

```
Field Description
```
```
Action Button (Mandatory)
```
```
Specify the Rule type action button that this alert should trigger.
```
```
Only the Rule type action button is supported in the action button config.
```
```
Trigger Measure (Mandatory)
```
```
The measure containing the scheduled execution time for the Action Button.
```
```
The Trigger Measure must be of a datetime data type.
```
```
Filter Expression (Optional) This determines whether the Action Button should execute.
```

```
Action button and trigger measure configurations are single select.
All the fields except for alert type are allowed to be edited after saving the event based scheduler alert.
```
8. Click **Submit** to save the event based scheduler alert. Once Alert is configured, the platform will automatically trigger
the configured rule type action button as time hits the trigger time.

```
Payload Mapping : The platform provides the only trigger measure intersection details as a payload to the triggered rule type
action button. This payload can be used by creating Parentattribute and parentmeasure type Field Bindings.
The action button validations are not supported, any required validation should be taken before updating the trigger measure
with datetime or use the Event based scheduler’s filter expression.
The action button should be configured for the auto execute feature.
```
**User Workflow**

1. Login to the platform with relevant credentials.
2. Navigate to the workspace where the trigger measure is configured.
3. Update the trigger measure with a future datetime.
4. Configured rule type action button executes for this intersection once current time is equal to time updated in the
measure. During the rule action button execution for the above intersection, the platform will pass this measure
intersection members to rule action button in case parent type fieldbindings are created for these attributes and
measure.

```
Event based scheduler alert only executes the future events from the time it is configured.
Event based scheduler alert will trigger for events that have a time greater than the last triggered time. The "last triggered" time
is defined as the last time the "Event based scheduler" alert was triggered. Example: If the last event was on July 25, 2025, at
10:00 PM, and the current time is July 25, 2025, at 10:50 PM, any event with a time greater than 10:00 PM will be executed by
the scheduler.
It is the configurator's responsibility to create the necessary validations to ensure that new events are created with a time that is
greater than or equal to the current time.
When event based scheduler alert is configured for the first time, only the future date and time are considered for execution and
events with a past datetime will not be executed.
```

```
Design Considerations
```
```
GraphCube to be running during events. If GraphCube is down then the event might need to be manually executed once the GraphCube
comes up or corresponding event time has to be updated for event based scheduler to pick up.
By default the current working View filter is applied for all the data. Only data in current working View are picked up by event based
scheduler alert for execution
Configured rule type action buttons that run at a specified event will only need the corresponding members as input.
There might be some delay in triggering the action button for execution if there are more than 10-20 active events at any given time.
