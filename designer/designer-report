The Designer workspace enables to build and maintain the tenant data model, the HTML UI configuration and the Excel
UI configuration.
```
```
A user with the admin user role can create tenant data model, such as dimensions, attributes,
hierarchies, measures, and computation rules. It also allows to configure the UI reports, such as pivot,
line chart, etc.
By default, the Designer workspace displays the Report Designer area.
```
```
Note
```
```
The Designer workspace also allows you to click Edit Model and go to the Model Designer area.
You cannot modify the model while working in the Report Designer because it displays the tenant model in
the read-only mode.
```
```
The users with the Admin user role (System Architect and UI Designer user roles) can configure
atomic widgets or reports from the Report Designer in Designer workspace as shown in the image
below. These reports can be used to configure UI Views. o9 supports various types of reports. You
need to click the relevant report type to configure it.

```
These reports are self-sufficient, which don't need any external information to display planning data.
They can be used in the HTML or the Excel UI to configure a View or can be seen from the Report
workspace for quick data analysis. Views can display multiple atomic widgets in various visually
appealing layouts as discussed in the coming sections. Users with the Admin user role or business
users with the UI Designer/System Architects user role can access and configure different kinds of
widgets. Users with the UI - Designer Private role can only configure private reports and cannot share
with the general audience. They can click the relevant report type to configure it as shown in the
image above.

In Designer, two distinct modes exist for editing Model and Reports. In order to perform any action,
users need to ensure that they are working in the correct edit mode. The user workflow is improved as
the selection is made automatic. Users no longer need to toggle the edit modes, explicitly.
The Edit Reports and Edit Model buttons in the Designer are no longer visible because the Toggle
Mode is introduced.
On the Designer load, both the models area and reports area are displayed. Users can navigate
through the tabs to any entity that they need to view or edit.

```
Note If you click an entity, it is displayed in the Edit mode by default.
All the secondary actions are available just as before.
```
If you click a measure, the measure edit area is displayed (as shown in the image below). Here, you
can edit the measure config, and other primary or secondary actions can be performed just as before.

If you click a report, it is displayed as the image shown below. If you click **( )** , the entity’s config is

displayed as a pop-up window.

```
Note The actions to drag and drop entities to the reports area and the other secondary actions are available just asbefore.
```

```
The atomic widgets can be configured in different ways for different people in the organization depending on their org
hierarchy. Grid personalization provides the ability to use the same underlying atomic widget but it makes changes to the
layouts, filters, etc. and save it as a favorite.
```
```
Favorites are View-specific (instead of Filter-specific). The pivot layout changes are saved with the
favorite (instead of using the browser cache). This means that the user can see his layout changes on
multiple machines, instead of just one. For linked pivots, the linked row is being remembered with the
favorite (instead of simply automatically linking using the first row). As an example, the pivot filter
search text is being remembered with the favorite (instead of being discarded when the on-grid filter is
closed).
```
1. Click the relevant option in the Filters list on a specific View and modify the layout.
2. Click **( )** to add the current selection as a Favorite.
3. Type the name and description for this filter.
4. Click **Add**. The details are added to Favorite and now available in the relevant View.

5. Click **Layout** on a specific View. The **Layout** dialog box is displayed.
6. Select and clear the relevant options.
7. Click **Save**. A customized layout is displayed.

```
Note
```
```
A user can again add this layout as a Favorite so that next time this is available in the relevant View.
When a user links a Pivot report to any other widget, the same filters are passed to the secondary widget
and is saved as a favorite.
